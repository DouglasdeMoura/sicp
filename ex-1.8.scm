; EXERCISE 1.8: Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that
; if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better
; approximation is given by the value ((x/(y^2)) + 2y) / 3

; -----| ANSWER |-----

(define (cube-root x)
  (cube-root-iter 1.0 0 x))

(define (cube-root-iter guess old-guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess old-guess)
    guess
    (cube-root-iter (improve guess x) guess x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess))
      (* 2 guess))
        3))

(define (square x) (* x x))      

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess old-guess)
  (< (abs (- guess old-guess)) 0.001))
